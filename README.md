  ## Description
  
  The purpose of this project is to build the API for a new social media platform called Social Thoughts. The idea is to have a faster way to leave comments in the form of 'thoughts' as more of a reaction rather than an entire message. This project includes the use of a recently learned language of 'mongoose'.
