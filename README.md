  ## Description
  
  The Social Thoughts API is a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete thoughts and reactions to those thoughts. Users can also add and remove friends from their friend list. The API is built using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. This application allows for friends to be connected both to their thoughts and to other users, as well as tally reactions to individual thoughts.
